## 🚀 Overview

**EasyGamePort** is an **open-source plugin** for **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** that automates console porting workflows end-to-end.  

It comes with a **built-in AI Agent**, a **knowledge base**, and a curated automation task catalog so that when you download the plugin, you immediately have everything you need to start porting your game.  

It handles:  
- Save systems and slot management  
- Achievements / trophies  
- Console activities and presence  
- Certification checklist helpers  

**Supported Platforms:**  
- PlayStation 4 / 5  
- Xbox One / Series X|S  
- Nintendo Switch  

> 💡 *From six months and $100K… to two weeks and zero stress.*

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Traditional console porting is:  
- ❌ Expensive ($100K+)  
- ❌ Slow (4–6 months)  
- ❌ Painful (cert rejections, SDK issues, controller mapping nightmares)  

**EasyGamePort** changes that:  
- 🩷 Automates the porting workflow end-to-end  
- 🩷 AI-guided setup and code analysis  
- 🩷 Ready-to-use systems for saves, input, achievements, and activities  
- 🩷 Reduces porting time from months to days  
- 🩷 Requires no prior console experience

## ⚙️ How It Works

**The plugin + AI Agent + knowledge base workflow:**

1. **Install the plugin** – add EasyGamePort to your Unity or Unreal project.  
2. **AI Agent analyzes your project** – the knowledge base provides platform rules and best practices.  
3. **Auto-implement essentials** – saves, input, achievements, console activities are added automatically.  
4. **Follow step-by-step plan** – test on devkit, the AI fixes errors automatically.  
5. **Certification checklist** – iterate to stability and compliance.

🟩 *Result:* A ready-to-publish console build in **days**, not months.

## 🔌 Integrations & Automation
- Deep hooks into Unity and Unreal via MCP to access engine objects and automate repetitive editor tasks.
- Console SDK adapters that validate requirements, generate TODOs, and rebuild projects for each platform.
- Automated patches for input, save systems, achievements, and console activities to keep builds cert-ready.
- Retrieval-backed AI guidance sourced from platform docs, past logs, and indexed project history.

---

## 🧰 In-Editor Experience
- Open the dockable window via `Window → EasyGamePort`; Unity remembers your layout between sessions.
- A staged loading sequence initializes the catalog, showing progress for initialization, project analysis, and final checks.
- Browse curated automation tasks, expand them for guidance, and execute runs with live status chips (Idle, Running, Completed, Error) and streamed logs.
- Customize workflows by editing or adding tasks, swapping IMGUI for UI Toolkit, or piping in a live backend agent through the existing state hooks.

- **Unity**  
- **Unreal Engine** (5.x)
