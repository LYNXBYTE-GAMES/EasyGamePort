## 🚀 Overview

**EasyGamePort** is an **open-source plugin** for **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** that automates up to **70% of the console porting process**.  

It comes with a **built-in AI Agent** and a **knowledge base** so that when you download the plugin, you immediately have everything you need to start porting your game.  

It handles:  
- Save systems and slot management  
- Controller input mapping  
- Achievements / trophies  
- Console activities and presence  
- Certification checklist helpers  

**Supported Platforms:**  
- PlayStation 4 / 5

> 💡 *From six months and $100K… to two weeks and zero stress.*

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Traditional console porting is:  
- ❌ Expensive ($100K+)  
- ❌ Slow (4–6 months)  
- ❌ Painful (cert rejections, SDK issues, controller mapping nightmares)  

**EasyGamePort** changes that:  
- 🩷 Automates 70% of the process  
- 🩷 AI-guided setup and code analysis  
- 🩷 Ready-to-use systems for saves, input, achievements, and activities  
- 🩷 Reduces porting time from months to days  
- 🩷 Requires no prior console experience

## ⚙️ How It Works

**The plugin + AI Agent + knowledge base workflow:**

1. **Install the plugin** – add EasyGamePort to your Unity or Unreal project.  
2. **Select the target platform** – PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch presets.  
3. **AI Agent analyzes your project** – the knowledge base provides platform rules and best practices.  
4. **Auto-implement essentials** – saves, input, achievements, console activities are added automatically.  
5. **Follow step-by-step plan** – test on devkit, the AI fixes errors automatically.  
6. **Certification checklist** – iterate to stability and compliance.

🟩 *Result:* A ready-to-publish console build in **days**, not months.
