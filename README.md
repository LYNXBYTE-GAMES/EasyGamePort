## 🚀 Overview

**EasyGamePort** is an **open-source plugin** that automates up to **70% of the console porting process** for **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** projects.  
It handles everything from save systems and input mapping to achievements, console activities, and certification helpers — allowing **any developer** to release their game on **PlayStation**, **Xbox**, or **Nintendo Switch** without deep platform knowledge or massive budgets.

- 🩷 AI-guided setup and code analysis
- 🩷 Ready-to-use systems for saves, input, achievements, and activities
