# EasyGamePort
EasyGamePort is an open-source plugin that fully automates the technical aspects of game porting. It handles the implementation of save systems, controls, achievements/trophies, console activity, and much more, enabling game developers with no porting experience to independently bring their games to consoles at minimal cost.
